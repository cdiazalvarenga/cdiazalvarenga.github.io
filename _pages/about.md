Hello! I am Carlos Diaz Alvarenga a PhD Candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of California, Merced. I currently work in the [Robotics Lab](https://robotics.ucmerced.edu) under the supervision of prof. Stefano Carpin. My research intersets broadly speaking are in robotics, reinforcement learning, and control. Specifically, we have worked on problems in the realm of Security Games, Monte Carlo Tree Search for robots in a vineyard, and Trajectory Optimization for teams of robots.
